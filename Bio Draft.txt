Hello, Iâ€™m Dennis, a student learning about UX/UI Design and Interaction Design at Simon Fraser University (SFU) in Vancouver, Canada. Currently, I'm working as an accessibility digital project assistant for SFU. In this role, I have had the opportunity to make an impact on how students with accessibility-needs prepare for job-searching online. It has been exciting and rewarding to see how technology and design have enhanced our capabilities in ways a few years ago, we only imagined. I'm of the mindset that a design should feel instinctive and be almost invisible to our users.
